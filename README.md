# Scheduling-from-Appointy

I created an easy to use Graphical Interface that helped my client make a very specific schedule based on information from a website. My client wanted a schedule to have more features than what was procided by this website. 

The AppointmentsReport file is the file from the website and the Final_Product is a sample of how the new schedule would look.
